Procedure for the experiment is as follows.

#### Experiment 1:

- Choose experiment type by pressing the "Switch experiment" button on the bottom left.
- Select the looping construct with which you want to solve the problem.
- Enter the number for which factorial has to be calculated and press OK.
- Press Start to start the experiment.
- Click Next to get a step by step execution of the code.


#### Experiment 2:

- Choose experiment type by pressing the "Switch experiment" button on the bottom left.
- Enter the height of pyramid and press OK.
- Press Start to start the experiment.
- Click Next to get a step by step execution of the code.

#### Manual

Here we shall see how various looping constructs can be used to find the factorial of a positive integer.
 
In the other part of the experiment, we shall see how nesting of loops can be done to create a pattern of any size that looks like a pyramid.
